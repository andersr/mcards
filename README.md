== Meditation Cards

Meditation Cards are a digital version of a personal practice that I have developed over the last several months, in which I have a stack of 4x6 index cards on my bedside table, each with a positive and/or constructive statement to meditate on.

Each morning, I pick up the stack, shuffle it, and then spend about a minute or so meditating on each card.

On occasion, I will think of a new meditation cards and add it to my stack.

The [Meditation Cards](htt://mcards.herokuapp.com) app is essentially a digital version of this idea.

With the [current release](https://github.com/andersr/mcards/releases/tag/v1.0), the app is very simple: you are presented with 5 cards randomly selected from a collection of about 15, and can swipe through each card, and meditate on the corresponding phrase or instruction.

In my personal collection, I have also included names of people who I want to remember.  For future versions, I hope to add this ability to create custom cards for app users, as well as hopefully many other features.

Enjoy!
